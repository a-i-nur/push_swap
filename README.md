Push Swap Roadmap
=================

This repository contains my implementation plan for the `push_swap` project. The goal is to develop a performant stack-manipulation program using a custom libft, a solid architecture, and well-chosen sorting algorithms.

Project Tasks
-------------
1. Merge all required helpers into a single libft (including `printf` and `gnl`). +
2. Write the project `Makefile`. +
3. Set up the project architecture (entry point plus headers).
4. Implement the main push_swap logic.
5. Add the bonus features.
6. Polish this README.

Evaluation Focus
----------------
- **Stack Usage**: how the A/B stacks are structured and updated.
- **Algorithm Design**: the sorting strategy and pivot logic.
- **Performance**: number of operations produced for various input sizes.
- **Big-O Analysis**: reasoning about the time complexity of the chosen approach.
